Description
As someone who heavily enjoys clothing, I wanted to create an app that resonates with that. So I made an app that allows you to look through clothes, that you might be interested in, and will show you a description of what the clothes are, like designer, year it was made, etc. a personalized fashion discovery app that curates clothing store recommendations based on your chosen style preferences, from Y2K and grunge to streetwear and beyond. By selecting or uploading your favorite aesthetics, the app generates a list of both mainstream and niche stores that align with your vibe. Whether you're refreshing your wardrobe or deepening your aesthetic, StyleMe bridges the gap between your style and the brands that get it.
